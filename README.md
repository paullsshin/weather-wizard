### **Usage** üíª
* Users can type in a city that they want to search.
* Once the city has been entered the user can then hit the "Click to Search" button to generate cards on the weather currently and for the next 5 days.
* There will be a main card displaying the location name, date, temperature, wind speed, humidity, and pressure. Then there will be 5 cards below it showing the forecast for the next 5 days. Those cards will display the temperature, wind speed, and humidity.
* If the user wants to look at something that they searched before then they can click on the name below the search bar to generate that city's weather information again.
